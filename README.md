### Hi there 👋 ###

👨‍💻 I’m currently working on graduating my bootcamp and getting my first tech job.

⚛️ I’m currently learning as a bootcamp Student at Awesome Inc U and specializing in the LAMP stack (with some JS and React as well)

🍻 I’m looking to collaborate on anything!

🐮 Fun fact: I worked as a meat cutter through college, so I know a lot about meat, especially beef! 

🎮 I'm a huge gamer! 📖 Love to Read! 🤓 Always want to learn, especially with tech!
